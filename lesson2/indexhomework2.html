        <p class="paragraph-1"> <span class="word">This</span>  hike is one of the most challenging I have attempted, as the elevation is fairly steep and some parts of the trail are quite rocky and require a bit of a scramble. You must bring plenty of water (at least two litres per person) as there is nowhere to fill up your water bottle except in the stream. It starts fairly easily with a path that winds its way back and forth through dozens of switchbacks until you reach Columbia Rock, with some lovely views including of Half Dome, a huge granite slab that rises nearly 5,000 ft above Yosemite Valley.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-2"> <span class="word">Then</span> the real work begins as you are taken to the west of Yosemite Falls, another thunderous waterfall with a 320 ft drop. The rocky trail zig zags uphill for several hours and it is fairly strenuous. That being said, about halfway up we once came across a hiker sitting on a camp chair cheerfully drinking a bottle of whiskey. Your hard work is rewarded as you reach the “overlook” which takes you to a viewing platform on the edge of the waterfall where you can gaze across the park. The journey back is almost entirely downhill (a challenge in its own way) that would be greatly aided by trekking poles.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-3"> <span class="word">Though</span> it doesn't have the most exciting name, the Four Mile Trail is notable for being an incredibly enjoyable trail with lots of variety and fantastic viewpoints. It begins at the valley floor and takes you to Glacier Point. It also has the benefit of having a road at the top, so you can get a bus back to the bottom if you only want to go one way (check in advance to make sure the road is open, as it was closed throughout 2022).</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4"> <span class="word">The</span> first part of the hike is gentle and covered with wildflowers if you visit at the right time of year (they are at their most blooming in May and June). Around almost every corner you'll be presented with another great view, from Yosemite Falls to Cathedral Rocks, considered one of the most beautiful rock formations in the park due to their unusually symmetrical appearance. You'll also be able to see El Capitan, whose vertical rockface is a popular draw for hardcore climbers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-5"> <span class="word">This</span> is the ideal trail to finish off your trip if your legs are feeling a bit sore from days of steep hikes. Yosemite has three sequoia groves (Mariposa, Merced and Tuolumne), and I encourage you to visit at least one on your trip. These beautiful trees, the Giant sequoias, are the sole living species of their genus. They can reach up to 300 ft tall with diameters up to 26 ft – that's more than four tall people stuck together.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-6"> <span class="word">Merced</span> Grove is probably the least visited of the three and you'll need to drive there. A wide footpath takes you through the sunlight-dappled forest down a steep path for just over a mile before you reach the first giant sequoias.</p>

        <p id="seventh-paragraph"> <span class="word">The</span> park has made efforts to protect the trees, whose roots are sensitive, so there are barriers around the trees themselves. You'll spend much of this hike looking straight upwards in awe at the height and beauty of these trees, whose bark is a distinct cinnamon-red.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-8"> <span class="word">The</span> walk back is mostly uphill, but it's not particularly challenging terrain. Merced Grove isn't always open to visitors, so check in advance. Tuolumne is a great alternative but can get a bit busier.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-9"> <span class="word">I</span> have visited Yosemite twice this year, and both times stayed at Yosemite Bug Rustic Mountain Resort located in Midpines, about an hour's drive from the park itself. Accommodation at the resort is very reasonably priced, starting from just $18 + tax for a dormitory bed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-10"> <span class="word">The</span> resort also has a cafe that serves alcohol, and a spa (only $15 to use and has a huge metal hot tub). I would highly recommend booking a private cabin, which is incredibly roomy, quirkily decorated with lots of antique furnishings, and surprisingly luxurious.</p>
