    <h2>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

    <p> <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting <mark>by her sister on the bank,</mark> and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
    <p> <u>So she was considering in her own mind</u>  (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth <s>the trouble of getting up and picking</s>  the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

    <p> <i>There was nothing so<!--  very remarkable --> in that;</i> nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
